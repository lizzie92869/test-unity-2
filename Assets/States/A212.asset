  storyText: This is not what Tom meant. He only wanted to discover his new toy but
    couldn't because you had it. How would you like for Tom to take the superheroes
    coloring book you came with and start coloring the picture you wanted to work
    on next? It wouldn't feel good, would it? It is always nice to ask before to borrow
    something.
